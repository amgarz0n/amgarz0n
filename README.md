### Hello Hello!! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Angelica M. Garzon, and I am a designer that loves letters. Having been introduced to design at a young age, I have developed an eye for clean aesthetics and functional design. I am a fast learner, and I've learned to move fast. Feel free to contact me, or check out my LinkedIn to learn more about my experience. Have a great day!
